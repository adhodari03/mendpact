# Architecture

MendPact separates protocol discovery, deterministic analysis, model drivers, grading, and
reporting. The current vertical slice implements the first, second, and final layers without
requiring a paid model API.

                                           v
                                  deterministic checks
                                           |
                                           v
                                JSON + terminal report
```

The separate `mendpact conformance` path invokes the pinned official MCP conformance CLI as a
child process. It validates the target first, runs the upstream package without a shell, reads
the emitted `checks.json` files from an ephemeral directory, and normalizes them into the
provider-neutral MendPact report schema. The npm package remains an external executable rather
than a Python dependency so its version and supply-chain boundary stay explicit.

## Boundaries

- `domain.py` owns provider-neutral, serialized data structures.
- `adapters/` converts protocol-specific objects into the domain model.
- `checks/` operates only on the normalized capability graph.
- `scanner.py` orchestrates a run and determines its CI status.
- `reporting.py` renders stable machine and human interfaces.
- `security/` rejects unsafe targets before network access.
- `conformance.py` owns the pinned external runner boundary and result normalization.

The next provider layer will implement a small `ModelDriver` protocol. OpenAI's implementation
will use Responses API tool calling, while Anthropic and Google implementations will emit the
same MendPact trace model. The evaluation engine will therefore remain comparable across model
providers.

## Why PostgreSQL later, not a graph database now?

The in-memory Pydantic graph is sufficient for endpoint scans. The hosted product can persist
nodes and edges in PostgreSQL and use recursive CTEs for reachability, delegation loops, and
unsafe-path queries. A dedicated graph database is unnecessary until measured workloads prove
otherwise.
